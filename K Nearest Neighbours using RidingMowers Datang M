# BUSINESS ANALYTICS APPLICATION: 
To predict the situation of similar kind of condition, this ML technique is used. If we get CAT exam marks of students of previous year then we can predict 
that whether a student will be placed in IIMs or not. We only compare with the similar kind of scores.
When a mobile phone company sets its price of its products, it takes into account the prices of similar phones.

## DATA: The data provides income and lot size of individuals. We want to predict with some certain situation, whether the individual will be owner of mowers or not.

### DESCRIPTION: 
K-Nearest Neighbours is a very widely and commonly used supervised machine learning technique for Predictive analytics. It is mainly used for predicting 
a particular category. It also can be used for predicting numerical values.
In Linear Regression models, we take different values which are not so much specific for a particular category. These are more general models. But, in KNN, 
we make prediction on the basis of similar kind of data. Hence, this model is much more specific and the prediction accuracy is better. In KNN, we have only the 
numerical predictors.
KNN model is data driven, not model driven and it does not make any assumption about the data. For a given record, the model identifies nearby records by measuring 
distance. The most popular distance measure is Euclidean distance.
We want to choose how many kâ€™s are needed. K=1 means single nearest record, k=5 means, 5 nearest records. We take that value of k, that has low error rate in validation.

#### RESULTS & DISCUSSION: 
We add number column to eliminate the confusion of Python numbering. First of all, we divide the data into training and validation. We want to predict whether
an individual with 60k USD income and lot size 20 will be a owner or non-owner.
Normalizing is import for nearest neighbours. We are processing the standard scaler for training data. We are incorporating the new household in the data. 
4,14 and 1 are the nearest members.
We are training data for k in range 1 to 15 then printing accuracy for the validation data. We would take k=4. The target will be to choose the lowest value 
of k to preserve the local structure. K=0.9 is the smallest number with highest accuracy.
We will use k=4 to make the prediction. We use 24 observations. The Euclidean distance is calculated. 4th observation is the closest. Then, the 9th,14th 
and 1st are the next closest. We can clearly observe, 3 out of 4 are owners. Hence, the KNN technique predicts that, this individual will also be an owner.

##### IMPLICATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is a more precise and targeted way to predict. MLRM does not take only the similar values. Hence, the accuracy is better than the general ones.
